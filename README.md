# AUI BOT
> Made to serve Among Us Indonesia!

## Purpose
The story behind this bot is when a friend of mine, started a community server called [Among Us Indonesia](https://discord.gg/AUI). He wanted a `really private bot` just to serve his server with few functionalities which he can't find from another bot. So, I took my part helping him making this ðŸ˜„

## Library
This bot uses [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) with its core based on [Miku Bot](https://github.com/shidoitsuka/another-miku-bot).

## Features
Some of the features (you can still find some of them in other public bots, tho.)
- Starboard system (Miku)
- Logging system
- [Voice Master](https://voicemaster.xyz/)-like system
    - Join to create your own personal voice channel
